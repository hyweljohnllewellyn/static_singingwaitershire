<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GUSwdL_7iM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="200" height="150" frameborder="0"></iframe>Previously a choral scholar at New College, Oxford, Thomas has continued a successful performing career in baritone roles such as Dulcamara L’Elisir d’amore, Alidoro La Cenerentola, CIA director Manifest Destiny 2011 both for OperaUpClose, Marullo Rigoletto (Bury Court Opera), Lesbo Agrippina (Barber Opera), Frank Die Fledermaus (Bloomsbury Opera), Morales Carmen (Kentish Opera), Mr Slender/Bardolph in Salieri’sFalstaff and Erimante in Cavalli’s Erismena both for New Chamber Opera, and Benoit/Alcindoro La Boheme for British Youth Opera once again. Other past roles include Belcore, Onegin, Count Almaviva and Mozart’s Figaro; other operatic work includes chorus for ENO, Garsington and Grange Park Opera.</p>
<p>Highlights of his concert work include The Messiah with the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra in Nicosia, the song project Lads in their hundreds directed by Iain Burnside at Kings Place and on BBC Radio 3, in which his contribution was singled out by Opera Now magazine as ‘a tour de force’, and Ives’ General William Booth enters the Kingdom of Heaven with Sir Andrew Davis and the BBCSO at the Barbican Hall. Other oratorio repertoire recently performed includes Bach’s St John Passion, Cantata 140 Wachet Auf and B minor Mass, Rossini’s Petite Messe Solonelle, and Haydn’s Nelson Mass. He has also sung with the Mark Morris Dance Company on their 2009 UK tour performing Schubert lieder at venues including Sadler’s Wells, Cardiff’s Millenium Centre and Snape Maltings.</p>
<p>A talented baritone such as Thomas is the perfect compliment to complete a trio act of soprano, tenor and baritone.</p>

Catherine was very accommodating with the repertoire of songs that we wanted and sang them beautifully. It made such a difference to have someone who was not only organised and professional but also sympathetic to the importance of the event for Lucy and I. We would not hesitate to recommend Hartley Voices and Catherine Fish to anyone looking for wonderful performers for an event. Thanks again, Kind regards, Will”</p>

I am SO delighted that I found you and decided to ask you to sing – I can’t bear to think that it was all done at the last minute and that we might not have had you! The ambience you created was unforgettable, really. You struck exactly the right note. Some of the most gratifying comments were from of the “tougher” contingent of our guests – namely some of the older men from Scarborough – who are usually very “matter of fact” about things. They all said they had lumps in their throats and were barely keeping it together!! You added to my personal memories of the day so much. I loved your choice of Casta Diva to walk into – it really gave grand status to the occasion and made me feel elegant and beautiful! You turned the (civil) ceremony from something I felt was going to be an anti-climax into the highlight of my day – which if I think about it, is really how it ought to be. Many thanks again, Sophie”</p>
