Catherine was very accommodating with the repertoire of songs that we wanted and sang them beautifully. It made such a difference to have someone who was not only organised and professional but also sympathetic to the importance of the event for Lucy and I. We would not hesitate to recommend Hartley Voices and Catherine Fish to anyone looking for wonderful performers for an event. Thanks again, Kind regards, Will”</p>

Therefore, she is the ideal performer to match your specific event. Her voice would suit any religious or civil ceremony, reception, corporate event/society or recital using her varied and adaptable repertoire.</p>

I am SO delighted that I found you and decided to ask you to sing – I can’t bear to think that it was all done at the last minute and that we might not have had you! The ambience you created was unforgettable, really. You struck exactly the right note. Some of the most gratifying comments were from of the “tougher” contingent of our guests – namely some of the older men from Scarborough – who are usually very “matter of fact” about things. They all said they had lumps in their throats and were barely keeping it together!! You added to my personal memories of the day so much. I loved your choice of Casta Diva to walk into – it really gave grand status to the occasion and made me feel elegant and beautiful! You turned the (civil) ceremony from something I felt was going to be an anti-climax into the highlight of my day – which if I think about it, is really how it ought to be. Many thanks again, Sophie”</p>
