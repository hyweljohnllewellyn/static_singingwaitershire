<p>Where accompaniment is concerned, she is also well experienced at singing with harpist, pianist, organist, string quartet, choir, a cappella, high quality recorded backing accompaniment and more. She is happy to work with musicians whom you’ve arranged independently, or to organise accompaniment per your request. If you are unsure of what you’d like, Lisa is happy to talk you through the options based on your venue.</p>
